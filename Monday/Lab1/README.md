* Launch a new virtual machine into a new Resource Group. Select the "Visual Studio Community 2015 Update 3 with Azure SDK 2.9 on Windows Server 2012 R2" image for your virtual machine.
* RDP to your dev vm. Disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration using the Server Manager
* Initialize Azure RM PowerShell and make sure you can use the Login-AzureRmAccount cmdlet with your Azure account.
* Install Github for Windows (we'll need the Git Shell later).
