* Create a new resource group in the portal
* Create a Windows 2012 R2 and Ubuntu Server 14.04 VM in your new resource group
* Verify that you can connect via RDP and SSH to your servers
* Delete the resource group
* (Optional) Review the code in the New-AzureServer.ps1 script. Create a new server using this script
* (Optional) Try out the VMAccess extension to create a new local admin account or to reset the existing account password, verify this works (you can use the portal for this one)
