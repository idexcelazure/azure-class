# Lab 4 - Change VM size, resize the OS disk, add a data disk

Create a new Windows VM and use the Azure portal to do the following:

* Scale up to a larger VM size
* Resize the OS disk on your VM
* Add an SSD-based data disk to your VM
* You'll need a Windows VM for the next lab. You can stop and deallocate this one and use it later to save some time
