# Lab 5 - Setup Azure File Share

You can use your dev VM as your Windows client in this lab

* Create a storage account if you don't already have one. Make sure that it is a standard storage account type
* Go to files
* Create a new file share
* Map the drive locally (on your "dev" VM) and ensure you can read/write to it
