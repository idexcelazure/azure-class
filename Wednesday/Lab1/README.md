# Lab 1 - Add network security group rules using PowerShell

This lab shows you how to modify an existing PowerShell script that creates an Azure Virtual Machine.

* Open the New-AzureServer.ps1 script from Monday Lab 3
* Use the code sample in this repo to add a network security group with a custom rule and associate with the subnet created by the New-AzureServer.ps1 script
* Launch a VM using the new version of your script and ensure your rule is created successfully
* Delete the resource group for this VM when complete
